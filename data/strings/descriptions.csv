chrn_pussypower,SHIP,"The Pussypower-class advanced omni cruiser is based on a heavily modified Champion-class heavy cruiser. Only one ship of this class has been made and it belongs to Catherine Knight - a special agent affiliated with Tri-Tachion. It is a versatile warship featuring a solid array of powerful weapons; the crowning element is a heavy energy turret mounting, with built-in experimental plasma cannon. This hungry monster is backed by a robust energy grid capable of supercharging the energy weapon loadout, increasing damage output to devastating levels. Features reinforced hull, additional armour and extra pair of engines, compared to base Champion model. Two medium missile hardpoints and a medium universal turret were squeezed into design to provide exceptional firepower. A heavy missile hardpoint was replaced with a large frontal hangar that can launch wings of custom fighters and bombers. However, it is not possible to remove or reverse-engineer these unique LPCs. All these enhancements require more expensive and delicate maintenance. The Pussypower is basically a battle-line dominatrix, able to bully even some capital ships on its own.",,,
ophira,SHIP,"This is a custom modification of a low-tech Khopesh bomber hull. Ophira gained better speed, durability and payload. ",,,
vasari,SHIP,"This is a custom modification of a midline Thunder heavy interceptor hull. Vasari sacrificed third of its original engagement range and some hull strength for higher wing size, better armour and flare launcher. ",,,
chrn_plasma,WEAPON,"This is an experimental version of a plasma cannon, one of the most terrifying things in the Sector. This one was built on Omega Site by Tri-Tachion specialists using [SUPER REDACTED]. The so-called Ministry of Technological Standards strongly disapproves of such an approach to developing superior weaponry but was unable to confiscate it. According to a few remaining reports of the incident, the weapon had suddenly become ""alive"" moments before so-called ""inspectors"" were unalived. ",,,
